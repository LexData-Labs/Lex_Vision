INSTALLATION IN PROGRESS
========================

The Python dependencies are currently being installed.

Current Status:
---------------
✅ Virtual environment created
🔄 Installing dependencies (dlib is currently compiling)

The dlib library (used for face recognition) needs to be compiled from source
on Windows, which can take 5-15 minutes depending on your system.

Please be patient. The installation will complete automatically.

You can monitor progress by checking for new output from the pip install command.

Once complete, the frontend dependencies will be installed next.
